      <p> <i> Hot pot with friends on a Friday night be like... </i> </p>

      <p> Hot pot is a form of communal dining where people gather around a big pot of boiling broth on a single burner and cook their own meats and vegetables. It is like an Asian fondue, but rather than dipping cubes of bread in cheese we're swishing slices of fatty beef in delicious broth. There are two kinds of hot pot soup: spicy and coconut milk. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat (beef, lamb, goat), leaf vegetables, mushrooms, different kind of dumplings, tofu and seafood (prawns, clams, squid,...) and more. There are plenty of restaurants specialized in hot pot, but it's easy to make your own for a party or Sunday dinner. </p>

      <p> <i> Eating dim sum for the first time with local friends... </i> </p>

      <p>There is an ancient Chinese tradition of drinking tea, known as yum cha, and with tea it's common to eat little bite sizes dishes which are known as dim sum. That's why dim sum is often served at teahouses and always goes with hot tea. This is one of the most fun and delicious food experiences you can have. </p>

      <p> We tried different kinds of noodles (egg noodles, rice noodles,...) in traditional restaurants. Besides beef balls and fish balls, we can also choose dumplings, beef tenderloin, deep-fried fish skin and more. The fish balls are made from mince fish and boiled in a soupy broth. </p>
