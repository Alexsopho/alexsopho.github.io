	<h2> <b> 2. Hiking to <i>Lions rock</i></b></h2>
	<p> When talking about best views of the city of Hong Kong, people tend to say that Victoria peak is the best view over Hong Kong. However after living 6 months in Hong Kong, we all agree that the best view is from Lions rock. To get to the top there are no cable cars or roads, the only solution is hiking threw the jungle and the monkeys! Another incredible experience with one of the best sunsets in the world...

	<h2> <b> 4. Street walking </b></h2>
	<p> In the end, the best way to explore this city is just to get lost in it. Walking around the city is the best way to understand how crazy and amazing Honk Kong is. The goal is just to get lost in the busy roads of Hong Kong and explore the hundreds of street markets Hong Kong offers and the dozens of temples all around the city...
