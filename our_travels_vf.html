      <h1> Singapore </h1>
      <img src="SG-flag.png" width="65" height="65" alt="SG-flag">
      <h4><i> A weekend in the Lion City... </i></h4>
      
      <p> Singapore is South East Asia’s most prosperous city and smallest nation by land area. In recent years, newly developed mega-attractions and casino driven integrated resorts had transformed this "all work" economic powerhouse into one of the region’s most popular destinations for leisure travel. We visited Marina Bay Sands with the outstanding pool view, the Merlion Park and Gardens by the Bay with its futuristic gardens. We also went to Chinatown and Little India and finished our trip to Sentosa Island where there is the Universal Studios of Singapore. What you need to know about the local laws: feeding pigeons will cost you $500, walking in nude at home is illegal, and selling gum could land you two years in jail. </p>

      <img src="VT-flag.png" width="65" height="65" alt="VT-flag">
      <h4> <i>The ideal destination for taking a few days off from work...</i>  </h4>
      <p> We spent 4 days in Vietnam with friends. This country is known for its beaches, rivers, Buddhist pagodas and bustling cities. We first arrived in Da Nang which is a coastal city in central Vietnam known for its sandy beaches and history as a French colonial port. We saw the Dragon-shaped Bridge and visited Marble Mountains (mountains with caves and temples). Then, we stayed to Hoi An city known for its well-preserved Ancient Town, cut through with canals. From there, we went to the ruins of My Son Hindu temple, constructed between the 4th and the 14th century AD. The last day, we visited the local villages around and the picturesque rice fields by bicycle. A trip with lots of memories! </p>
